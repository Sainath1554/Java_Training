I am working in Optum which is a health insurance company. In my current project i work on a health care platform which makes it easy to find medications, refill prescriptions based on health care provider recommendations and also schedule tests and appointments. We also have several integrations with federal, state government and third-party agencies for providing these services. The ecosystem consists of several microservices, all of these built using Spring boot and leveraging some of the spring components and real time RESTful APIs using best REST principles. I also worked on some event driven use cases for which we leveraged Kafka to push some events to our backend data engine which is responsible for event processing. I was also responsible for helping with migration from legacy monolithic to microservices based architecture. Most of these newer services are containerized in Docker and these Docker images are orchestrated through Kubernetes. In our current project we are using AWS cloud platform and I have worked on their service offerings like EC2, lambda, S3.
We follow agile methodology in this project project and in this role, I had the chance to work on some interesting initiatives and solved some challenging problems. In general, I enjoy working in collaborative and challenging environments where there is a lot to learn and where there is an opportunity to deliver something meaningful.
